One should generally initialize weights with a small amount of noise for symmetry breaking, and to prevent 0 gradients. Since we're using ReLU neurons, it is also good practice to initialize them with a slightly positive initial bias to avoid \"dead neurons\". Instead of doing this repeatedly while we build the model, let's create two handy functions to do it for us."
