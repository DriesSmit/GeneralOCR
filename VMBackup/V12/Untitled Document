The system is able to calculate how well it identifies characters for the date and balance columns. This provides the system with an estimated accuracy matrix of how well it has captured the current statement's information. If this score is too low the system can display a notification that indicates that the statement should be evaluated manually. Thus, by combining the system and human's inputs the statement OCR error rate can be reduced even furthur than only using the system.
